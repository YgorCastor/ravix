# Ravix

Ravix is a project to implement a client for the amazing [RavenDB NoSQL Database](https://ravendb.net/), it's built based on the existing [Python client](https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb-python-client/tree/v5.0/pyravendb) and will strive to keep the same Way of Working as possible, keeping the same nomenclature and so on.
